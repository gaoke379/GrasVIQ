# GrasVIQ  

## Introduction  
Grass Vein Image Quantification (GrasVIQ) is an image analysis framework for automatic quantification of veins in grass leaves. Designed specifically for parallel venation, GrasVIQ automatically segments veins from images of cleared grass leaves using thresholding and edge detection techniques. Veins are quantified and classified into orders, and spatial parameters, such as vein width and interveinal distance, are calculated automatically.  


## Dependencies  
* MATLAB >= R2016a (Image Processing Toolbox required)
